# Multithreading Study
This is a proyect about concurrent programing for an Operating Systems subject at Universidad de Sevilla. It consists of an algorithm written from scratch in C++. We also improved this algorithm step by step to get the best results. The POSIX API has been used since the project was made in an Ubuntu OS.

All the project and study is written in Spanish.
